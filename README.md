# lost-and-found-app

This is a react and firebase app to upgrade the Lost and Found system in college campuses. Users that find someone's lost belongings or users that lose their own stuff can answer some questions about it. (what it is, where and when they lost it, etc) When someone's lost item matches something someone else found, the users are matched.

To run the app

enter the directory (cd lost-and-found)
run the command (npm start)
To Check the functionality:

Sign up as a new user
Sign in using those details
Try reporting a lost or found item
Go to dashboard to see a list of all your reported items
Click on one of the items to see possible matches
